End-to-end training methods such as Connectionist Temporal Classification make it possible to train RNNs for sequence labelling problems where the input-output alignment is unknown. The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs. When trained end-to-end with suitable regularisation, we find that deep Long Short-term Memory RNNs achieve a test set error of 17.7\% on the TIMIT phoneme recognition benchmark, which to our knowledge is the best recorded score. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Recognizing lines of unconstrained handwritten text is a challenging task. The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to exploit surrounding context, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their well-known shortcomings. This paper proposes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range bidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two large unconstrained handwriting databases, our approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79.7 percent on online data and 74.1 percent on offline data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. In addition, we demonstrate the network's robustness to lexicon size, measure the individual influence of its hidden layers, and analyze its use of context. Last, we provide an in-depth discussion of the differences between the network and HMMs, suggesting reasons for the network's superior performance. © 2009 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The analysis of human location histories is currently getting an increasing attention, due to the widespread usage of geopositioning technologies such as the GPS, and also of online location-based services that allow users to share this information. Tasks such as the prediction of human movement can be addressed through the usage of these data, in turn offering support for more advanced applications, such as adaptive mobile services with proactive context-based functions. This paper presents an hybrid method for predicting human mobility on the basis of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The proposed approach clusters location histories according to their characteristics, and latter trains an HMM for each cluster. The usage of HMMs allows us to account with location characteristics as unobservable parameters, and also to account with the effects of each individual's previous actions. We report on a series of experiments with a real-world location history dataset from the GeoLife project, showing that a prediction accuracy of 13.85\% can be achieved when considering regions of roughly 1280 squared meters.

Although it has been shown that these models obtain good performance on this task, often superior to other state-of-the-art techniques, they suffer from some important drawbacks, including a very long training time and limitations on the number of context words that can be taken into account in practice. Recent extensions to recurrent neural network models have been developed in an attempt to address these drawbacks. This paper gives an overview of the most important extensions. Each technique is described and its performance on statistical language modeling, as described in the existing literature, is discussed. Our structured overview makes it possible to detect the most promising techniques in the field of recurrent neural networks, applied to language modeling, but it also highlights the techniques for which further research is required. © 2014 The Authors.

The difficulty of segmenting cursive or overlapping characters, combined with the need to assimilate context information, has led to low recognition rates for even the best current recognizers. Most recent progress in the field has been made either through improved preprocessing, or through advances in language modeling. Relatively little work has been done on the basic recognition algorithms. Indeed, most systems rely on the same hidden Markov models that have been used for decades in speech and handwriting recognition, despite their wellknown shortcomings. This chapter describes an alternative approach based on a novel type of recurrent neural network, specifically designed for sequence labeling tasks where the data is hard to segment and contains long-range, bidirectional or multidirectional interdependencies. In experiments on two unconstrained handwriting databases, the new approach achieves word recognition accuracies of 79,7\% on on-line data and 74,1\% on off-line data, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM-based system. Promising experimental results on various other datasets from different countries are also presented.

These algorithms have recentlyshown impressive results across avarietyof domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood.Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-And discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine. © 2018 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) and their learning algorithms are well known in the academic community and industry as the most successful methods for big data analysis. Compared with traditional methods, deep learning methods use data-driven and can extract features (knowledge) automatically from data. Deep learning methods have significant advantages in analyzing unstructured, unknown and varied model and cross field big data. At present, the most widely used deep neural networks in big data analysis are feedforward neural networks (FNNs). They work well in extracting the correlation from static data and suiting for data application scenarios based on classification. But limited by its intrinsic structure, the ability of feedforward neural networks to extract time sequence features is weak. Infinite deep neural networks, i. e. recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are dynamical systems essentially. Their essential character is that the states of the networks change with time and couple the time parameter. Hence they are very suit for extracting time sequence features. It means that infinite deep neural networks can perform the prediction of big data. If extending recurrent structure of recurrent neural networks in the time dimension, the depth of networks can be infinite with time running, so they are called infinite deep neural networks. In this paper, we focus on the topology and some learning algorithms of infinite deep neural networks, and introduce some successful applications in speech recognition and image understanding. © 2016, Science Press.

An advantage of incorporating an autoregressive model is that the time dependency within acoustic feature trajectories can be modeled without using the conventional dynamic features. More interestingly, experiments show that this autoregressive model learns to be a filter that emphasizes the high frequency components of the target acoustic feature trajectories in the training stage. In the synthesis stage, it boosts the low frequency components of the generated feature trajectories and hence increases their global variance. Experimental results show that the proposed model achieved higher likelihood on the training data and generated speech with better quality than other models when dynamic features were not utilized in any model. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In electric vehicle (EV) systems, diagnosing battery states, such as state of health (SOH), is crucial to guarantee safety. Such a diagnosis can be used to determine the replacement time for a battery or to assess the driving mileage. The majority of studies in recent decades have defined SOH under fairly constrained assumptions, such as cycling within a fixed range and in fixed temperature. Unfortunately, the assumptions cannot be applied to real-life EV batteries, which for the most part are cycled arbitrarily. In clear contrast, this paper studies how SOH can be estimated in more practical environments, in which batteries must support real-world driving patterns. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to trace SOH using measurable EV data, such as current (I) and voltage (V). While the existing data-driven approaches are mostly based on historical I/V distributions, our approach utilizes time-varying I/V instantiations, each portraying a snapshot during a short period. In particular, we design a model based on a recurrent neural network, which is highly suited to handling the sequential data. Our validation provides very robust and flexible results under various EV driving conditions, with the average error lower than 0.0765 Ah (2.46\%) over all of our experiments. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Recently, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have shown promising performance in this task due to their strengths in modeling the dependencies and dynamics in sequential data. As not all skeletal joints are informative for action recognition, and the irrelevant joints often bring noise which can degrade the performance, we need to pay more attention to the informative ones. However, the original LSTM network does not have explicit attention ability. In this paper, we propose a new class of LSTM network, global context-aware attention LSTM, for skeleton-based action recognition, which is capable of selectively focusing on the informative joints in each frame by using a global context memory cell. To further improve the attention capability, we also introduce a recurrent attention mechanism, with which the attention performance of our network can be enhanced progressively. Besides, a two-stream framework, which leverages coarse-grained attention and fine-grained attention, is also introduced. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging datasets for skeleton-based action recognition. © 1992-2012 IEEE.},

To ameliorate this shallow modeling assumption, several authors have proposed models with higher-order dependencies. However, the practical applicability of these approaches is hindered by their prohibitive computational costs in most cases. In addition, most existing approaches give rise to model training algorithms with objective functions that entail multiple spurious local optima, thus requiring application of tedious countermeasures to avoid getting trapped to bad model estimates. In this paper, we devise a novel margin-maximizing model with convex objective function that allows for capturing infinitely-long temporal dependencies in sequential datasets. This is effected by utilizing a recently proposed nonparametric Bayesian model of label sequences with infinitely-long temporal dependencies, namely the sequence memoizer, and training our model using margin maximization and a versatile mean-field-like approximation to allow for increased computational efficiency. As we experimentally demonstrate, the devised margin-maximizing construction of our model, which leads to a convex optimization scheme, without any spurious local optima, combined with the capacity of our model to capture long and complex temporal dependencies, allow for obtaining exceptional pattern recognition performance in several applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This fact makes the training of sequence classifier be time consuming and the application of sequential learning from large scale data is difficult, especially when the available training data are sparsely labeled. This paper proposed a novel learning approach to build the sequence classifiers from a large amount of partially labeled training data. The mechanism of semi-supervised learning for classifier building from the partially labeled data is embedded in the computing framework of ensemble learning, which is adapted for distributed learning over large scale dataset.

Deep learning has attracted substantial attention across many domains of science and practice, because it can find intricate patterns in big data; but successful application of the methods requires a big set of labeled data. Active learning, which has the potential to address the data labeling challenge, has already had success in geospatial applications such as trajectory classification from movement data and (geo) text and image classification. This review is intended to be particularly relevant for extension of these methods to GISience, to support work in domains such as geographic information retrieval from text and image repositories, interpretation of spatial language, and related geo-semantics challenges. Specifically, to provide a structure for leveraging recent advances, we group the relevant work into five categories: Active learning, visual analytics, active learning with visual analytics, active deep learning, plus GIScience and Remote Sensing (RS) using active learning and active deep learning. Each category is exemplified by recent influential work. Based on this framing and our systematic review of key research, we then discuss some of the main challenges of integrating active learning with visual analytics and deep learning, and point out research opportunities from technical and application perspectives-for application-based opportunities, with emphasis on those that address big data with geospatial components. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {Existing RNN-based approaches for action recognition from depth sequences require either skeleton joints or handcrafted depth features as inputs. An end-to-end manner, mapping from raw depth maps to action classes, is nontrivial to design due to the fact that: 1) single channel map lacks texture thus weakens the discriminative power; 2) relatively small set of depth training data. To address these challenges, we propose to learn an RNN driven by privileged information (PI) in three-steps: An encoder is pretrained to learn a joint embedding of depth appearance and PI (i.e. skeleton joints). The learned embedding layers are then tuned in the learning step, aiming to optimize the network by exploiting PI in a form of multi-task loss. However, exploiting PI as a secondary task provides little help to improve the performance of a primary task (i.e. classification) due to the gap between them. Finally, a bridging matrix is defined to connect two tasks by discovering latent PI in the refining step. Our PI-based classification loss maintains a consistency between latent PI and predicted distribution. The latent PI and network are iteratively estimated and updated in an expectation-maximization procedure. The proposed learning process provides greater discriminative power to model subtle depth difference, while helping avoid overfitting the scarcer training data. Our experiments show significant performance gains over stateof-the-art methods on three public benchmark datasets and our newly collected Blanket dataset. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The linear-chain CRFs is one of the most popular discriminative models for human action recognition, as it can achieve good prediction performance in temporal sequential labeling by capturing the one-or few-timestep interactions of the target states. However, existing CRFs formulations have limited capabilities to capture deeper intermediate representations within the target states and higher order dependence between the given states, which are potentially useful and significant in the modeling of complex action recognition scenarios. To address these issues, we formulate a deep recursive and hierarchical conditional random fields (DR-HCRFs) model in an infinite-order dependencies framework. The DR-HCRFs model is able to capture richer contextual information in the target states, and infinite-order temporal-dependencies between the given states. Moreover, we derive a mean-field-like approximation of the model marginal likelihood to efficiently facilitate the model inference. The parameters of the predefined model are learnt with the block-coordinate primal-dual Frank-Wolfe algorithm in a structured support vector machine framework.

Tasks such as the prediction of human movement can be addressed through the usage of these data, in turn offering support for more advanced applications, such as adaptive mobile services with proactive context-based functions. This paper addresses the problem of predicting human mobility on the basis of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), an approach that allows us to account with location characteristics as unobservable parameters, and also to account with the effects of each individual's previous actions. We report on a series of experiments with both regular and second-order HMMs. The experiments were made with a real-world location history dataset from the LifeMap project, and the results show that a high prediction accuracy, relative to the dificulty of the task, can be achieved when considering relatively small regions. © 2012 ACM.},

	abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) are two popular techniques for modeling sequential data. Inference algorithms designed over CRFs and HMMs allow estimation of the state sequence given the observations. In several applications, estimation of the state sequence is not the end goal; instead the goal is to compute some function of it. In such scenarios, estimating the state sequence by conventional inference techniques, followed by computing the functional mapping from the estimate is not necessarily optimal. A more formal approach is to directly infer the final outcome from the observations. In particular, we consider the specific instantiation of the problem where the goal is to find the state trajectories without exact transition points and derive a novel polynomial time inference algorithm that outperforms vanilla inference techniques. We show that this particular problem arises commonly in many disparate applications and present experiments on three of them: (1) Toy robot tracking; (2) Single stroke character recognition; (3) Handwritten word recognition.},

	abstract = {Objective. Conventional decoding pipeline for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) consists of chained different stages of feature extraction, time-frequency analysis and statistical learning models. Each of these stages uses a different algorithm trained in a sequential manner, which makes it difficult to make the whole system adaptive. The goal was to create an adaptive online system with a single objective function and a single learning algorithm so that the whole system can be trained in parallel to increase the decoding performance. Here, we used deep neural networks consisting of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN) called long short term memory (LSTM) to address these needs. Approach. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) data collected by Kubanek et al. The task consisted of individual finger flexions upon a visual cue. Our model combined a hierarchical feature extractor CNN and a RNN that was able to process sequential data and recognize temporal dynamics in the neural data. CNN was used as the feature extractor and LSTM was used as the regression algorithm to capture the temporal dynamics of the signal. Main results. We predicted the finger trajectory using ECoG signals and compared results for the least angle regression (LARS), CNN-LSTM, random forest, LSTM model (LSTM-HC, for using hard-coded features) and a decoding pipeline consisting of band-pass filtering, energy extraction, feature selection and linear regression. The results showed that the deep learning models performed better than the commonly used linear model. The deep learning models not only gave smoother and more realistic trajectories but also learned the transition between movement and rest state. Significance. This study demonstrated a decoding network for BMI that involved a convolutional and recurrent neural network model. It integrated the feature extraction pipeline into the convolution and pooling layer and used LSTM layer to capture the state transitions. The discussed network eliminated the need to separately train the model at each step in the decoding pipeline. The whole system can be jointly optimized using stochastic gradient descent and is capable of online learning. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Considering the fact that light change and glasses could significantly increase the difficulty to monitor human eyes, fatigue detection was still an unsolved problem. A new driver fatigue method based on morphology infrared features and deep learning were proposed. Using 850 nm infrared light source, the facial image was obtained. Human faces and landmarks which indicated the area of eyes were located by Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with morphology features in infrared image. In the next step, a filter module which measured head displacement was added, aiming at reducing the impact of posture change. In the following, the collected facial states were transformed into sequential data. Finally, the sequential data was passed to the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to detect fatigue state by analyzing the sequential correlations. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the fatigue detection algorithm can reach 94.48\% with an average detection time of 65.64 ms. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Infrared and Laser Engineering.

However, most of them are based on the extraction of spectral feature, which leads to information loss. Moreover, they rarely consider the correlation among the spectrums. In this paper, we see spectral information as a sequential data which is relevant with each other. We introduce long short-term memory model, which is a typical recurrent neural network (RNN), to deal with HSI classification. In order to solve the problem of difficult to reach the steady state of the model, we proposed a novel guided filter based RNN model. Also, we proposed a method for modeling hyperspectral sequential data, which is very useful for future research work.

By investigating the learning capability of long-term dependencies from sequential data, in this paper, we propose a novel appearance model by transforming the target contextual dependency into a semantic sequential representation. It can be effectively utilized by a recurrent neural network embedded with bidirectional long short-term memory cells for online tracking-by-learning. Based on the trained BLSTM-RNN model, a searching mechanism by labeling score is proposed to improve the tracking robustness. With the implied appearance variation by labeling, the proposed tracking method has demonstrated to outperform most of state-of-the-art trackers on challenging benchmark videos via a heuristic strategy for model updating. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this work, we aim at providing a comprehensive Python library implementing conditional random fields (CRFs), a class of probabilistic graphical models, for robust prediction of these constructs from sequential data. Results: Python Sequence Labeling (PySeqLab) is an open source package for performing supervised learning in structured prediction tasks. It implements CRFs models, that is discriminative models from (i) first-order to higher-order linear-chain CRFs, and from (ii) first-order to higher-order semi-Markov CRFs (semi-CRFs). Moreover, it provides multiple learning algorithms for estimating model parameters such as (i) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its multiple variations, (ii) structured perceptron with multiple averaging schemes supporting exact and inexact search using 'violation-fixing' framework, (iii) search-based probabilistic online learning algorithm (SAPO) and (iv) an interface for Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and the limited-memory BFGS algorithms. Viterbi and Viterbi A* are used for inference and decoding of sequences. Using PySeqLab, we built models (classifiers) and evaluated their performance in three different domains: (i) biomedical Natural language processing (NLP), (ii) predictive DNA sequence analysis and (iii) Human activity recognition (HAR). State-of-the-art performance comparable to machine-learning based systems was achieved in the three domains without feature engineering or the use of knowledge sources.

	abstract = {The task of classifying EEG signals for self-paced Brain Computer Interface (BCI) applications is extremely challenging. This difficulty in classification of self-paced data stems from the fact that the system has no clue about the start time of a control task and the data contains a large number of periods during which the user has no intention to control the BCI. Therefore, to improve the performance of the BCI, it is imperative to exploit the characteristics of the EEG data as much as possible. For motor imagery based self-paced BCIs, during motor imagery task the EEG signal of each subject goes through several internal state changes. Applying appropriate classifiers that can exploit the temporal correlation in EEG data can enhance the performance of the BCI. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which is able to capture the temporal correlation of the EEG signal. We compare the performance of our algorithm that is based on neural network conditional random fields to two well-known dynamic classifiers, the Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields and to the static classifier, Support Vector Machines. We compare these methods using the data from SM2 dataset, and we show that our algorithm yields results that are considerably superior to the other approaches in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the BCI system. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose to separate the two steps and only consider the problem of relevant fact selection. We used a graphical probabilistic model Conditional Random Field (CRF) to model the interdependent relationship among the chaining facts in order to select the relevant ones. In our experiments on a benchmark dataset, we are able to select correctly all relevant facts from 13 tasks out of 19 tasks (F-scores of the rest of the 6 tasks range from 0.8 to 0.97).
