The main objective of the proposed work is to advance the research on the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to perform data carving, answering the following initial questions:

\begin{enumerate}[itemindent=\parindent,label=\textbf{Q\arabic*.}]
  \item How does LSTM compare to other techniques in terms of training performance and quality of results?
  \item Do the results obtained with usual datasets reflect what happens in real scenarios?
  \item Could a LSTM-based tool support a wider range of file types?
   \item Could a LSTM-based tool handle fragmentation through reassembling?
   \item Do LSTM neural networks help to interpret internal file structures?
  \item How can the process of adding support for a new file type be made easier?
  \item Could a LSTM-based tool accept the addition of new file types by the end-user, in a collaborative manner? 
  \end{enumerate}
